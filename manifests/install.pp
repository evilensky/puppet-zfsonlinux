# == Class: zfsonlinux::install
#
# This class will install zfsonlinux to the specified version.
# ZFS on Linux as provided by zfsonlinux.org has two major components:
# * SPL - The Solaris Porting Layer
# * ZFS itself
#
# Typically, the ZFS and SPL versions must match, but we provide the ability
# to override the individual component versions.
#
# == Parameters
#
# If a parameter is not specified, it will default to the value in
# zfsonlinux::params. See that class for values
#
# === Common Parameters
#
# [*version*]
#   The version of ZFS and SPL packages to install. Versions of individual
#   components can be set using the variables below.
#
# [*timeout*]
#   The timeout value to use for each step of the staging and build process.
#
# [*verbose*]
#   Turn on verbose mode when building ZFSOnLinux. Should be true or false.
#   Defaults to false.
#
# [*upgrade*]
#   Upgrade packages if they are already installed. Defaults to false since
#   this can leave a system unable to access critical filesystems if the ZFS
#   packages are removed while a system is running.
#
# [*dependency*]
#   If false, the module will not try to install package dependencies.
#   These must be provided elsewhere in your package configuration
#
# === Advanced Parameters
#
# [*spl_version*]
#   The version of SPL - the Solaris Porting Layer - to install. Only necessary
#   if you want to override the version parameter for this component.
#   *Don't do this unless you know what you're doing*
#
# [*zfs_version*]
#   The version of ZFS to install. Only necessary if you want to override the
#   version parameter for this component.
#   *Don't do this unless you know what you're doing*
#
# == Examples
#
#   # Install the current version as of this module's writing 0.6.0-rc8
#   include zfsonlinux::install
#
#   # More customized
#   class { 'zfsonlinux::install':
#     version     => '0.6.0-rc8',
#     spl_version => '0.6.0-rc7',
#     timeout     => '3600',
#   }
#
# == Caveats
#
# This has only been tested on CentOS 6.2 and with the 0.6.0 series of
# ZFSOnLinux.
#
# Specifiying a different version of spl_version and zfs_version may not work
# due to tight code dependencies
#
# Downgrading an already installed version of spl or zfs will not work
#
# Upgrading is particularly dangerous, as a system can be left without access
# to critical filesystems
